AI and ChatGPT (a variant of the popular language model GPT-3) have quickly become some of the most buzzworthy technologies in recent years, with many people eager to get in on the action and start building their own AI-powered applications. However, while the hype around these technologies is understandable, it's important to note that they also require a significant amount of knowledge and experience to use effectively.

The fact that so many API keys (which are used to access and authenticate the use of various online services and applications) have been publicly posted in code samples within just a few hours is a clear indication of this lack of experience. These keys, which are often used to access sensitive data or control valuable resources, can be exploited by malicious actors if they fall into the wrong hands.

This is a serious problem, as it exposes both individuals and organizations to a wide range of security risks. Hackers can use these keys to gain unauthorized access to systems, steal sensitive data, or even disrupt operations by accessing and manipulating critical resources.

But the issue goes beyond just security concerns. The lack of experience and understanding of how to properly use these technologies can also lead to poor quality products and services, as well as missed opportunities for innovation. Without a solid foundation in the underlying concepts and best practices, it's difficult to leverage the full potential of AI and ChatGPT.

To avoid these problems, it's crucial that those who want to use these technologies take the time to learn and understand them properly. This may involve seeking out specialized training or working with more experienced professionals to gain the necessary knowledge and skills.

In short, while the excitement around AI and ChatGPT is certainly justified, it's important to remember that they also require a significant investment in time and effort to use effectively. Without a solid foundation of knowledge and experience, the risks and drawbacks of these technologies will only continue to grow.

In less than 12 hours, I was able to find over 10 API keys that had been publicly posted in code samples.
